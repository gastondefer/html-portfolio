  My name is Gaoussou Traore, but I often go by my nickname Gaston.
  As you might have guessed, I am originally from Mali, a west african country twice the size of Texas.
  I moved to the U.S. in 2014 to pursue my education. I majored in Computer and Information Technologies with a degree of
  Applied Technology from South Texas College.This website is going to showcase some of the thing I distract myself with, moslty hobbies.
  I will talk about electronics, world event, workout etc...Picture me rolling âœŒ
